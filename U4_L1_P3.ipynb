    "This depends on whether or not we know what those variables are ahead of time.  If we do not know what those variables are, then it is unsupervised learning.  If we do know the variables we are attempting to predict, then it could be supervised learning.<br>\n",

    "This would be unsupervised learning.  We don't know ahead of time what those patterns might be and perform the learning to find them out.<br>\n",

    "This could be unsupervised learning.  For example, PCA can be used to determine the important variables.  The random forest model can also be used to select important features and input them into another random forest model.  This would be using supervised learning to select variables.  <br>"
